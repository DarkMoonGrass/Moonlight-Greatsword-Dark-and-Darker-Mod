# Instilation Process

Open your file that has the "Paks" in it

This should be by default

Steam- 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dark and Darker\DungeonCrawler\Content\Paks

Blacksmith-
C:\Program Files\IRONMACE\Dark and Darker\DungeonCrawler\Content\Paks

Then drag and drop "pakchunk800-Windows_1_P.pak" into that folder, make sure to not rename this file as it has to be this name for the game to recognise it.
